Back in 2013 I create a processing sketch by [extracting ship geometries from the original C source for Elite](http://fiskurgit.github.io/elite-model-viewer-for-processing). I've just written a hacky little java app to parse these [Processing](http://processing.org) files and spit out something [Processing.JS](http://processingjs.org/) can work with.
