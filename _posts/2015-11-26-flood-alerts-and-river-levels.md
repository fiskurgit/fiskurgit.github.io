I&#8217;ve just released two new Android apps that make use of the <a href="http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference" target="_blank">Environment Agency Real Time flood-monitoring API</a>. We live in a very wet part of the world and though we&#8217;re safe up on top of a hill the community down in town is often affected by floods from the River Calder.

## Flood Alerts

A simple app that shows any current floodÂ alerts for England and Wales, the 3 day flood forecast, and any local alerts on a map. Essential for the weather obsessed.

## River Levels

More useful for people where flooding is a real worry, see data from local measurement stations for the day and previous week.

Many additional features and improvements planned for both apps over the next few months. These apps make use of a library I&#8217;ve written for the Environment Agency service, as soon as it&#8217;s in a state fit for sharing I&#8217;ll make it public.
