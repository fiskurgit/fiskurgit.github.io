<a href="http://www.degree53.com/blog/2015/april/android-hockeyapp-upload-using-gradle" target="_blank">New post up on Degree53 blog</a>, it describes how to upload .apks to HockeyApp from <a href="http://www.go.cd/" target="_blank">Thoughtworks Go</a> using Gradle. One step that isn&#8217;t mentioned is calling a bash script from Go itself which can be a bit tricky if you don&#8217;t know the syntax, so here a screenshot that shows how it&#8217;s done:

That&#8217;ll also be my last blog at <a href="http://www.degree53.com/" target="_blank">Degree 53</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m moving to the countryside which would make the commute difficult, very sad to leave, it&#8217;s been a fantastic couple of years with the team there.
