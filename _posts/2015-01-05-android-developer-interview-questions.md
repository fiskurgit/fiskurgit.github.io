A list of questions/talking points for when interviewing candidates for Android roles, work in progress, will grow over time, <a href="https://github.com/fiskurgit/Documentation/blob/master/AndroidDeveloperQuestions.md" target="_blank">view on Github</a>. I&#8217;ve tried to leave out more obscure questions about archaic aspects of the platform that I&#8217;ve seen on other lists of Android interview questions, I don&#8217;t think they help evaluate a persons skill or knowledge.
