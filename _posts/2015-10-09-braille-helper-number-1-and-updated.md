Back in January 2014 I released a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiskur.braille" target="_blank">braille reference app on Android</a>, after a couple of updates it was rising up the charts on the Play Store but I hadn&#8217;t touched it since September 2014. I checked how it was doing last week and found it&#8217;s now the top braille app in the store and has some really positive reviews from people who find it useful, including some students and teachers.

This week I&#8217;ve updated the app, the biggest change being an update to a basic Material Design interface making the UI look fresher and more modern. I also made some changes to fix a couple of issues mentioned in the app reviews; a mistake with the &#8216;upon&#8217; contraction, and the omission of the # symbol prefix for numbers. The app now supports devices all the way back to Gingerbread which will allow users on older devices to use the tool.
