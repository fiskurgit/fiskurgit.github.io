A new update to the Fiskur Braille Guide app is [now live in the Google Play Store][1], it has some support for grade 2 contracted braille by adding a list of the most-used contractions and punctuation, there&#8217;s still lots to do but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. 

<img src="http://fiskur.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/braille_2_screenshot.png" alt="braille_2_screenshot" width="679" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-319" />

Some usability issues have also been fixed when using with Androids accessibility mode turned on, which make the app much more user-friendly for users with low vision, in a future release we hope the app will have additional features to teach braille. To implement these features we first need to figure out a way to completely disable Androids TalkBack accessibility feature when the user interacts with our custom UI. 

If you&#8217;d like to help with app, add features, or rewrite some of the hacky early code [join the Github project and submit a pull request][2].
