Android library that allows you to quickly add an image ViewPager to your app: [SimpleViewPager](https://github.com/fiskurgit/SimpleViewPager).  

Most commercial apps I produce have a ViewPager requirement somewhere, either working as a gallery or as an onboarding tutorial. They involve a fair amount of coding and it slows me down when producing the ui and prototype code, this library lets you add a ViewPager in a couple of minutes. More detailed info on the [Github readme](https://github.com/fiskurgit/SimpleViewPager).
