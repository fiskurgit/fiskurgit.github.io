# Hippocamp.net

Hippocamp was one of the early netlabels, it started in 2001 and was still releasing up to around 2015. I finally stopped paying for the site hosting in 2019.

Most of the releases are hosted by [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/hippocamp&tab=collection) with later releases self hosted, these can be [downloaded as a zip from my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
