# ND? ND.

I'm putting this blog here because I've been saving too many tweets that have little nuggets of wisdom in about autism and neurodiversity (or neurodivergent as an identifier (both use ND as shorthand)).

After someone I follow on Twitter [surfaced a thread](https://twitter.com/mykola/status/1112883937272107008) from [@mykola](https://twitter.com/mykola) using the [#actuallyAutistic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/actuallyAutistic) hashtag a lot of things about my own life snapped into place.

Why had I never considered the possibility I was autistic before? The answer:

> the autistic stereotype is DEFINED by autistic people in distress. [@NeuroRebel](https://twitter.com/NeuroRebel/status/1140225066568994817?s=19)

My own 'otherness' definitely manifests more when I'm under stress, and I've always needed to spend a lot of thought and energy into reducing stressful situations:

> We know autistic people look more autistic when under stress. So it seems to me that interventions either train people to appear less autistic (ABA) or genuinely improve stress levels etc for the autistic person so they then appear less overtly autistic.

ND people struggle in a world made largely by and for NT's (neurotypical people, see also _allistics_), the revelation you feel when you realise you're not alone, and all your past struggles now make more sense:

> You kinda go through life, nodding, thinking, okay. Just trusting and accepting what you're told, even when it clearly isn't working. You're used to the world being this big place full of things you don't understand. It's this minor brain explosion to realize maybe they're wrong. [@azrtairne](https://twitter.com/azrtairne)

A lot my own previous issues came from not fitting in, or struggling with processes and situations that only benefit NTs:

> ‘I like being autistic’ Unfortunately most of my Mental health issues are because some others don’t like me being autistic. [@soundcube](https://twitter.com/soundcube/status/1143891280562393088)

> So many autistic people experience mental health difficulties not because it’s inevitable but because the environment does not facilitate positive autistic MH. The origins of our mental health are often conflated and misunderstood. [@Sarahmarieob](https://twitter.com/Sarahmarieob/status/1144167434749906944)

and on being marked/_othered_ in the workplace:

> It only takes for an autistic person's social cues to be slightly off for them to be labelled as stand-offish, rude or just odd. Repeated throughout the course of a lifetime, these 'marginal losses' lead to lost social & work opportunities - *this* for many is the disability [@npaa_uk](https://twitter.com/npaa_uk/status/1119832459510734849)

I've always called myself introverted and everyone close to me knows that I need time to 'recharge' or 'decompress' after I've been in a social situation:

>The neurotypical schedule doesn’t allow autistic people enough recovery/processing time between events, especially if an autistic person is already dealing with another stressful situation or change. I process on a delay & need the solitude to unravel everything [@NeuroRebel](https://twitter.com/NeuroRebel/status/1143859560660291587)

[This whole thread of responses](https://twitter.com/Shona_Mu/status/1133737425744879616) to the question _'What was the best part of realising you are autistic?'_ is full of people describing the same thing I experienced.
