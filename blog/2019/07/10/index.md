# ND? ND.

I'm putting this blog here because I've been saving too many tweets that have little nuggets of wisdom in about autism and neurodiversity (or neurodivergent as an identifier, both use ND as shorthand).

After someone I follow on Twitter [surfaced a thread](https://twitter.com/mykola/status/1112883937272107008) from [@mykola](https://twitter.com/mykola) using the [#actuallyAutistic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/actuallyAutistic) hashtag a lot of things about my own life snapped into place.

Why had I never considered the possibility I was autistic before? The answer:

> the autistic stereotype is DEFINED by autistic people in distress. [@NeuroRebel](https://twitter.com/NeuroRebel)

> You kinda go through life, nodding, thinking, okay. Just trusting and accepting what you're told, even when it clearly isn't working. You're used to the world being this big place full of things you don't understand. It's this minor brain explosion to realize maybe they're wrong. [@azrtairne](https://twitter.com/azrtairne)
