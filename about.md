Based in beautiful Todmorden in West Yorkshire, UK.

My personal apps are delivered using a Kaizen approach: continuous improvements and regular releases building upon an initial minimal release.

I’ve been working in the mobile industry since 2005, originally specialising on BlackBerry, focus moved to Android when it appeared in 2008. I’ve worked on projects for Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, Sainsbury’s, the Metropolitan Police, RentalCars.com, BlackBerry, plus countless others. In addition to various development contracts I operate as Head of Native Dev and Scrum-Master, regularly write functional and technical specifications, and have plenty of experience mentoring junior developers.
